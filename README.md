# pyDLP
Python implementation of the index calculus method for solving discrete logarithms.

## About
[Index calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_calculus_algorithm) is a probabilistic method for solving [discrete logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm) problems. As of this writing, there do not appear to be many implementations of index calculus. Hopefully this can serve as a useful reference. Note: this script requires that [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) be installed to solve the system of linear equations. 

## Usage

```Bash
python2.7 ./pyDLP.py
```
